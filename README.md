# Tokyo Night Tmux

A clean, dark Tmux theme that celebrates the lights of Downtown [Tokyo at night.](https://www.google.com/search?q=tokyo+night&newwindow=1&sxsrf=ACYBGNRiOGCstG_Xohb8CgG5UGwBRpMIQg:1571032079139&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiayIfIhpvlAhUGmuAKHbfRDaIQ_AUIEigB&biw=1280&bih=666&dpr=2)
The perfect companion for [tokyonight-vim](https://github.com/ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim)
Adapted from the original, [Visual Studio Code theme](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme).
The old version (deprecated) is still available in the `legacy` branch.

## About this theme

This is a very opinionated project, as I am a Tech Lead, this theme is very developer-focused.

## Requirements

### Nerd Fonts

This theme requires the use of a patched font with Nerd Font. Ensure your terminal is set to use one before installing this theme. Any patched font will do. See
[`nerdfonts.com`](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for more informations.

### Noto Fonts

This theme requires the Noto fonts to be installed on your operating system. Make sure your operating system has the needed font and is configured to use one.

### Installation using TPM

In your `tmux.conf`:
```
set -g @plugin "janoamaral/tokyo-night-tmux"
```

### New tokyonight Highlights âš¡

Everything works out the box now. No need to modify anything and colors are hardcoded, 
so it's independent of terminal theme.
